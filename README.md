# Website by Vaibhav Bidkar - Team Coaching and Player Management

## Overview:
I have developed a user-friendly website to assist coaches in managing multiple sports teams. This platform allows coaches to organize and oversee teams and their respective players. The website offers various features such as adding and deleting players, updating player statistics, and managing teams efficiently.

## Key Features:

### Team Management:

- Coaches can create and manage multiple teams they are responsible for.
- Teams can be added or deleted as needed, ensuring a dynamic and adaptable structure.
  
### Player Management:

- Coaches have the ability to add new players to each team.
- Existing players' information can be updated, including statistics and personal details.
- Players can be removed from a team or the system entirely.
